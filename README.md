# EncryptionActivity

This C++ code takes an input text file and encrypts the data by the given XOR-Encryption key and outputs an encrypted and decrypted text file. The encrypted file contains the input text file in a security-safe format with a name and timestamp at the top. The decrypted shows what the input data file was with the same name and timestamp at the top.
